# About Blog

This folder contain my weekly notes for everything I found and thought. They will be messed notes since my approach is *just write*. So they are just like semi-*zettelkasten*. Sometimes I will write in English, in the other times it will in Indonesian.

The notes work as a starting point to more deep and through notes in another folder. The flow will be look like this:
1. Write everything in a single weekly document into [blog] folder or into [bookmarks] note.
2. Expand some interesting snippets in a weekly document or bookmarks into a single page note in [note] folder.
3. Expand the interesting [bookmarks] note or [blog] content into respective list-style folders such as [app], [book], [course], [research] folder, etc.
4. The notes in list-style folders will link-heavy notes (list of links with little explanation).
5. Expand interesting notes in the [note] folder into a tutorial or a book in their respective project-style folders, for examples: [markdown], [pvsystems], etc.
6. The notes in project-style folders will content-heavy notes (descriptive notes supported with citations (links)).
