This folder contain my weekly notes for everything I found and thought. They will be messed notes since my approach is *just write*. So they are just like semi-*zettelkasten*. Sometimes I will write in English, in the other times it will in Indonesian.

# About Blog

The notes work as a starting point to more deep and through notes in another folder. The flow will be look like this:
1. Write everything in a single weekly document into [Blog](../blog/about_blog.md) folder or into [bookmarks](../blog/bookmarks.md) note.
2. Expand some interesting snippets in a weekly document or bookmarks into a single page note in [Note](../note/about_note.md) folder.
3. Expand the interesting [Bookmarks](../blog/bookmarks.md) or [Blog](../blog/about_blog.md) content into respective list-style folders, for examples:
   - [App](../app/about_app.md) folder for applications or softwares.
   - [Book](../book/about_book.md) folder for books or tutorials.
4. The notes in list-style folders will link-heavy notes: list of links with little explanation.
5. Expand interesting notes in the [Note](../note/about_note.md) into a tutorial or a book in their respective project-style folders, for examples:
   - [Markdown](../markdown/about_markdown.md) for book project about markdown.
   - [PVSystem](../pvsystem/about_pvsystem.md) for book project about PV System.
6. The notes in project-style folders will content-heavy notes: descriptive notes supported with citations (links).
