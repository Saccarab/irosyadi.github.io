### Canary Tokens
Suppose you have situation like this. You want to be warned if some one access your file, your folder, your email, your image, etc.   
So you put a token, transparent in your file/folder/email/image, which will warn you if someone open it. That is how [Canary Tokens](http://canarytokens.org/) work

### Accuracy, Precision, Error
- Accuracy is closeness of the measurements to a specific value
  - More commonly, it is a description of systematic errors, a measure of statistical bias; low accuracy causes a difference between a result and a "true" value. ISO calls this trueness.
  -  the accuracy of a measurement system is the degree of closeness of measurements of a quantity to that quantity's true value
  - bias is the amount of inaccuracy
- Precision is the closeness of the measurements to each other
  - Precision is a description of random errors, a measure of statistical variability. 
  - The precision of a measurement system, related to reproducibility and repeatability, is the degree to which repeated measurements under unchanged conditions show the same results.
  - variability is the amount of imprecision

Accuracy has two definitions:
- More commonly, it is a description of systematic errors, a measure of statistical bias; low accuracy causes a difference between a result and a "true" value. ISO calls this trueness.
- Alternatively, ISO defines accuracy as describing a combination of both types of observational error above (random and systematic), so high accuracy requires both high precision and high trueness.
