- [Git Most Wanted](http://gitmostwanted.com/)
- [Github Top Programming Languages](https://githut.info/)

## Robotics
- [Drake ](https://drake.mit.edu/) : Drake aims to simulate even very complex dynamics of robots (e.g. including friction, contact, aerodynamics, …), but always with an emphasis on exposing the structure in the governing equations (sparsity, analytical gradients, polynomial structure, uncertainty quantification, …) and making this information available for advanced planning, control, and analysis algorithms. Drake provides an interface to Python to enable rapid-prototyping of new algorithms, and also aims to provide solid open-source implementations for many state-of-the-art algorithms.
