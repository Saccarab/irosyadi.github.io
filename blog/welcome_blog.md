This folder will contain my weekly notes for everything I found and thought. It will be messed notes since my approach is *just write*. Sometimes I will write in English, in the other times it will in Indonesian.

The notes work as a starting point to more deep and through notes in another folder. The flow will be look like this:
1. Write everything weekly to `blog` folder or into `bookmarks` note
2. Expand the interesting notes in the blogs into `note` folder
3. Expand the interesting `bookmarks` into respective list folder:
   4. `app` folder for applications or softwares
   5. `book` folder for books or tutorial
4. Expand interesting notes in the `note` into respective project folder, for example:
   5. `markdown`for project book about markdwon
   6. `pvsystem` for project tutorial about PV System
