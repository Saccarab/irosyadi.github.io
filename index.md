# irosyadi, an introduction

_notes of a life_

This is my personal wiki a.k.a my second brain notes where I share everything I like.

The notes can be accessed at [Netlify Site](https://irosyadi.netlify.app/), [Gitbook Site](https://irosyadi.gitbook.io/),  [Github Pages](https://irosyadi.github.io/), or directly as markdown files in my [Github](https://github.com/irosyadi/gitbook).

I'm writing the notes using [VNote](https://tamlok.gitee.io/vnote/en_us/) then sync the notes to Gitbook and Netlify repository using [SyncFolder](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/syncfolder/9nc73mjwhsww) for Windows 10.


_Enjoy!_
