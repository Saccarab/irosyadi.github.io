# About Note

This folder contains more deep and detiled explanation from what I wrote in [Blog](../blog/about_blog.md) or saved link in [bookmarks](../blog/bookmarks.md). If I find something which is interesting and needs more explanation or description, I'll put it as a note in this repo.

A note in this folder can be expanded further into specific project-style folder, for examples:
   - [Markdown](../markdown/about_markdown.md) for book project about markdown.
   - [PVSystem](../pvsystem/about_pvsystem.md) for book project about PV System.
